The proposed exclusions are:  \n(a) Industrial or commercial premises; \n(b) The location of the snake is unknown, or the snake was sighted some time ago; \n(c) Public places e.g. along the 1000+ Steps Bald Hill and there is no immediate threat to \nthe community; \n(d) Snakes in their natural habitat (it is illegal to remove snakes from their natural \nhabitat); \n(e) In rural locations and more than 10m from a dwelling. \n5.

The evaluation is proposed to include: \n(a) The location and spread of calls received; \n(b) The type of snakes (as identified by the contractor); \n(c) The time to respond to calls; \n(d) The number of snakes successfully located and relocated; and \n(e) The actual costs to provide the service.", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nItem 15.1 Page 25 \n \nThe evaluation would assist Council in deciding if the trial should be extended for a longer \nperiod, discontinued or provided as an ongoing service. \n \n \nRATIONALE \nA report on the possible provision of a snake catching service trial for Moorabool Shire Council \nresidents was presented at the OMC held 3 July 2024. \nIt identified that in Australia there are around 130 species of snakes with approximately 74 being \nvenomous. Moorabool Shire Council is home to some of the most venomous snakes in the world, \nand the only municipality in Australia to house all of Red- Bellied Black Snakes, Eastern Brown \nSnakes, Eastern Tiger Snakes and Copperheads, all of which are highly venomous. \nSnake encounters are common in peri-urban areas such as Moorabool due to the mix of urban and \nrural environments. Due to the rapid growth in some areas of MSC there are housing estates", "rural environments. Due to the rapid growth in some areas of MSC there are housing estates \nincreasingly being built that are encroaching into areas that are traditionally a safe habitat for \nsnakes. This has led to increased snake sightings and has led to further sightings and encounters \nbetween snakes and residents, which can pose a risk to community safety. \nAs we enter the 2024/25 summer it has been apparent that there has been an increasing number \nof snake sightings (as per reports from private snake catchers and based on feedback on various \nresident page s on social media) and with the expected further growth in population it is \nreasonable to expect a continuation of increased sightings and encounters, leading to further \nincreases to community safety.  \nIt is noted that neighbouring and nearby Councils have a free snake removal service in place and \nthese include City of Hume, City of Melton, Brimbank City Council and Hobsons Bay Council.", "these include City of Hume, City of Melton, Brimbank City Council and Hobsons Bay Council. \nThe report presented to Council on 3 July 2024 noted that number of calls for snake removal does \nvary significantly depending on the region and the level of snake activity. The report estimated \nthat, noting the geographic area of the municipality, the cost of a callout and the anticipated \nnumber of calls during the trial period, that engaging a licensed snake catcher/s is expected to cost \nbetween $40,000 and $50,000 for the 1 November to 31 March period.  \nI commend this Notice of Motion to Council.", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nPage 26 \n16 NOTICES OF RESCISSION \nNil", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nItem 17.1 Page 27 \n17 MAYOR\u2019S & COUNCILLORS REPORTS \n17.1 MAYOR'S REPORT \nAuthor: Dianne Elshaug, Co-ordinator CEOs Office \nAuthoriser: Derek Madden, Chief Executive Officer  \nAttachments: Nil  \n  \nPURPOSE \nTo provide details to the community on the meetings and events attended by the Mayor since the \nlast Ordinary Meeting of Council.  \n \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThat the Mayor\u2019s Report be tabled for consideration at the Ordinary Meeting of Council. \n \nRECOMMENDATION \nThat Council receives the Mayor\u2019s Report.", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nItem 17.2 Page 28 \n17.2 COUNCILLORS REPORTS \nAuthor: Dianne Elshaug, Co-ordinator CEOs Office \nAuthoriser: Derek Madden, Chief Executive Officer  \nAttachments: Nil  \n  \nPURPOSE \nTo provide details to the community on meetings and events attended by Councillors since the last \nOrdinary Meeting of Council. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThat the Councillors Reports be accepted for consideration at the Ordinary Meeting of Council. \n \nRECOMMENDATION \nThat Council receives the Councillors Reports.", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nPage 29 \n18 URGENT BUSINESS", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nPage 30 \n19 CLOSED SESSION OF THE MEETING TO THE PUBLIC  \nRECOMMENDATION \nThat Council considers the confidential report(s) listed below in a meeting closed to the public in \naccordance with Section 66(2)(a) of the Local Government Act 2020: \n19.1 C0156-2024/2025 Clarendon - Lal Lal Road Reconstruction \nThis matter is considered to be confidential under Section 3(1) confidential information -  (g) of the \nLocal Government Act, and the Council is satisfied that discussion of this matter in an open \nmeeting would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest as it deals with private commercial \ninformation, being information provided by a business, commercial or financial undertaking that  \n(i) relates to trade secrets; or \n(ii) if released, would unreasonably expose the business, commercial or financial undertaking to \ndisadvantage. \n19.2 Ingliston Road, Ballan - Additional Works under Contract C0145 2024/2025", "disadvantage. \n19.2 Ingliston Road, Ballan - Additional Works under Contract C0145 2024/2025 \nThis matter is considered to be confidential under Section 3(1) confidential information -  (g) of the \nLocal Government Act, and the Council is satisfied that discussion of this matter in an open \nmeeting would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest as it deals with private commercial \ninformation, being information provided by a business, commercial or financial undertaking that \n(i) relates to trade secrets; or \n(ii) if released, would unreasonably expose the business, commercial or financial undertaking to \ndisadvantage.", "Ordinary Council Meeting Agenda 5 February 2025 \n \nPage 31 \n20 MEETING CLOSURE"]
